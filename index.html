            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Currently in my 5th year at Georgia Tech I am an economics major after my first four years of being a mechanical engineering major. This has allowed me to develop a solid understanding of both concepts and allows me to bridge the gap between engineering and economics as needed. I have a passion for all things economics and financial related, along with a passion for video games and am interested in working in the financial technology industry or gaming industry.

                  Because of an interest to possibly enter the gaming industry I am currently serving as the Head of Marketing for an amateur Esports organization in Europe. During my time, I helped lead a rebrand of the organization to convey a more modern and professional look to the organization. Along with this, I helped develop an investment proposal for possible investors that lead to a 12,000 GBP per year investment from NordVPN. Currently, I am working alongside the Content Director to develop player showcases in order to market the content team in a more effecient manner.

                  <p>
                  During the spring of 2018, Claxton Cold Storage aquired another cold storage facility and was in need of finding buisness to make the secondary facility financially feasible. As a marketing intern, I went through about a week of training in which I spent time in the office learning everyone's role in handling the front side of the buisness, while also shadowing people inside the cold storage warehouse in which I gained exposure to how product is handled and transferred throughout the day. After gaining a general understanding of the role and function of a cold storage facility I began researching companies and reaching out to companies in search of their buisness. At the end of the summer I was able to help contribute to the secondary facility being completely full.

                  Throughout my time at Applied Indsutrial Controls I spent a two week training period working on electrical panels on the production floor to understand the time and reuirements needed to build the panels. After my training period I was involved with data collection in which I would record details about the panels, including number of components, number of wires and size along with time spent on each panel to develop a better pricing method for customers. During this time I became very familar with Excel VBA.

                  <p>
                  All throughout my time in high school I was heavily involved in tennis and was offered the chance to continue helping out by being an assistant for the summer after my senior year. During this time, I worked with players from ages 12 to 18 develop their tennis skills through exercise and tennis drills. I also worked the desk during tennis tournaments and assigned players to courts and recorded scores to keep the tournament running in an efficient manner. In the summers after, I would frequently return to help and coach tennis in my free time.
